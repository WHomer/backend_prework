## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is similar to a function, however it is tied to an object.  A function is used when you need to repeat your code or have abstraction from your code.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone("Sam")`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

Nothing at this time.
